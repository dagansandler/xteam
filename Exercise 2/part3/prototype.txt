Differences between Java Inheritance and Javascript Prototypes:

While both create a notion of OO structure, there are a few differences:

1) In Java, copying happens at compile time, where in JavaScript operations are stored in the prototype data structure, which is copied and modified at run time.
2) JavaScript prototypes are shared between "inheriting" classes, meaning they expand that prototype rather than creating a new instance of it.
3) Javascript prototypes can be redefined at runtime, and have immediate effect on existing objects, whereas Java classes can't be redefined to reflect changes on existing instances.
