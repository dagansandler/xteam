This repository was used for a class in Current Internet Technologies at Ben-Gurion University, Israel.

Our way of life/coding:
-----------------------
<blockquote>
"Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, 
ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' 
Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer."
</blockquote>
-- Steve McConnell, software engineer and author, from "Code Complete".
