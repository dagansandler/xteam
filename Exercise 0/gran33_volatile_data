Evgeny Morozov, the author known for his viciously mocking criticism of web culture, 
has described internet search giant Google as a firm that is run by adolescents. 
Morozov, the author and critic battling 'the internet' itself, 
said that Google leaders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have weird ideas about the world out there and those ideas they developed in the mid-90s when they were at Stanford. 
According to the Telegraph, Morozov said that he thinks they genuinely believe their own rhetoric on things like having search implanted in our brain, like Sergey Brin mentioned a while ago.
