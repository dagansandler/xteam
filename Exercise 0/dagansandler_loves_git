1) Git is a Distributed VCS. This means that the repository isn't only "checked out" as a snapshot of the latest files, but is in fact cloned entirely.
This means there is no single point of failure in Git, as everyone has the entire repository on their work station.

2) Git was first introduced in 2005 by the Linux community as an open system for version control that will be independent & free, and able to cope with large projects like the Linux kernel project.
