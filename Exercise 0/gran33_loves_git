Something I learned about Git:
Git is a Distributed VCS. This means that the repository isn't only "checked out" as a snapshot of the latest files, but is in fact cloned entirely.
This means there is no single point of failure in Git, as everyone has the entire repository on their work station.

A difference between Git and Subversion:
Git was designed to be fully distributed from the start, allowing each developer to have full local control
