1. Git - Snapshots, Not Differences

Git vs. SVN:
1. Git is much faster than Subversion
2. Subversion allows you to check out just a subtree of a repository.
	Git requires you to clone the entire repository (including history) and create a working copy that mirrors at least a subset of the items under version control.
